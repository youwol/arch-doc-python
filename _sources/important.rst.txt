Important
=========

- :ref:`Forward` is still a work in progress and some available solvers might not work as expected...

- Constraints **only** apply with the solver `seidel` or `jacobi` in :ref:`Forward`
  
- In some cases, the `seidel` and `jacobi` solvers may diverge. These cases are
  
  1. when triangles intersects (in some cases)

  2. when two close triangles make a small angle between them

- :ref:`UserRemote` and :ref:`AndersonianRemote` strain are not yet implemented
