.. py:class:: Interpolation

    On a triangulated surface, allows to interpolate a scalar, displacement or stress field
    from vertices to triangles or from triangle to vertices.

    .. py:method:: Interpolation(surface: Surface)

        The constructor

        :param Surface surface: The considered surface

    .. py:method:: fromVerticesToTriangles(field: Vector) -> Vector

        Convert the scalar, displacement or stress field defined at vertices to triangles

        :param Vector field: The field defined at vertices
        :return: The converted field at triangles

    .. py:method:: fromTrianglesToVertices(field: Vector) -> Vector

        Convert the scalar, displacement or stress field defined at triangles to vertices

        :param Vector field: The field defined at triangles
        :return: The converted field at vertices
